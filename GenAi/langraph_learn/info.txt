INSTALLATION
pip install -U langgraph












⭐ LangGraph — IMP ONLY

LangGraph is used to build stateful, multi-step LLM workflows using graphs

Works on nodes + edges + shared state

Supports branching, loops, retries, multi-agent flows

Built on top of LangChain

Best for agent systems, RAG, long conversations

👉 LangChain = linear flow
👉 LangGraph = decision-based flow

⭐ Checkpointer — IMP ONLY

Checkpointer saves graph execution state

Enables resume after crash

Stores memory, variables, messages

Required for long-running agents

Common types: Memory / SQLite / Redis / Postgres

👉 Think of it as “Save & Resume for AI workflows”

⭐ Model Evaluation in LangGraph — IMP ONLY

LangGraph does NOT auto-evaluate models

Evaluation is done using custom nodes

Used to check:

Output quality

Hallucinations

Agent decisions

Often uses LLM-as-a-Judge

Evaluation result controls:

Retry

Loop

Accept / Reject output

⭐ One-Line Final Summary (Very IMP)

LangGraph builds stateful agent workflows,
Checkpointers persist execution state,
Model evaluation is added via custom evaluation nodes to control retries and quality.
